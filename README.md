# A_Game (Temporary Title)
A game made in Unity to help me understand how game design in Unity Engine works.
In more detail, this game is a simple three-dimensional platformer game where you play as a character to collect items while avoiding enemies and traps.

This repository will be used for uploading the code I write.
